# TYPING-SPEED-TEST
This Python script is designed to gauge users typing speed, measuring in words per minute (WPM).
Upon initiation, it prompts users to commence typing, indicating they can press Enter to start and to create new lines.
Utilizing the time module, it records the onset of typing and its cessation, calculating the elapsed time, total characters, and words typed.
The script then computes the average WPM based on these metrics.
After assessment, it offers feedback tailored to the user typing speed, suggesting areas for improvement or commending proficient performance.
Its objective is to provide users with a straightforward tool for self-assessment and to encourage ongoing practice for skill enhancement.
